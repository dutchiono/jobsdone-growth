# Advertising Channels

## Priority Order for Online Customers

We're shifting focus from local-only to online-first. Here's the recommended channel stack:

### 1. Cold Email (Start Here — Free, Fast)
- Scrape Google Maps for businesses with no website or dead socials
- Also works for online: search Etsy, Thumbtack, Yelp for businesses missing web presence
- Personalize with their name + what's broken ("Your Yelp page has no photos and your website returns a 404")
- See `EMAIL.md` for template

### 2. Facebook & Reddit Groups (Free, Community-Driven)
- Target: small business owner groups, contractor forums, freelancer communities
- Don't spam. Share a before/after result or offer free setup for one member
- Subreddits: r/smallbusiness, r/Contractor, r/pressurewashing, r/lawncare

### 3. X / Twitter (Brand + Investor Audience)
- Tweet proof-of-work: "We just automated 5 platforms for a landscaper in Phoenix. $99/mo."
- See `TWEETS.md` for the full tweet bank

### 4. Meta Ads (Paid — Start Small)
- $10/day, 1 ad set, 1 creative
- Audience: business owners 30–55, US, interests in home services / contracting
- See `ADS.md` for copy

### 5. Google Local Services Ads
- Highest intent — people searching "website for my business" or "social media help"
- More expensive but buyer intent is real
- Set up after cold email is proven

### 6. Referral Program
- Give existing customers 1 month free for each referral who signs up
- Word of mouth from tradespeople is strong (tight-knit communities)

## What NOT to Do Yet
- Don't run ads before email is tested
- Don't pay for influencer posts before organic is working
- Don't build a TikTok presence until bandwidth allows
