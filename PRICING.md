# Pricing Strategy

## Current Pricing
$9/month — underpriced and signals low value before anyone reads the features.

## Why We Need to Raise Prices

The market rate for just social media management is $500–$2,500/month.
We do more: website + Google Business + 5 social platforms + auto cross-posting.

At $9 we need 1,111 customers to hit $10k MRR.
At $99 we need 101.

Raising prices also filters for customers who take the service seriously.

## Recommended Tiers

| Tier | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Starter** | $49/mo | Website + Google Business + 1 social platform |
| **Pro** | $99/mo | All 5 platforms + cross-posting automation |
| **Done-For-You** | $199/mo | Pro + we write and schedule 3 posts/week |

## Annual Discount
Offer 2 months free on annual (e.g., $990/yr for Pro = saves ~$200).

## Online Customer Adjustment
For customers outside our local area, lean on the $99 Pro tier as the anchor.
Done-For-You at $199 converts well for online customers who don't want to touch anything.
