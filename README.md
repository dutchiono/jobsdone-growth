# jobsdone.team — Growth Playbook

This repo is the single source of truth for our marketing strategy, pricing, and advertising for [jobsdone.team](https://jobsdone.team).

It's designed for the team to read, comment on (via Issues), and iterate fast.

## What's in here

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------||
| `PRICING.md` | Recommended pricing tiers and rationale |
| `CHANNELS.md` | Where to advertise and in what order |
| `EMAIL.md` | Cold email template + sending guide |
| `TWEETS.md` | Tweet bank — hooks, traction, investor content |
| `ADS.md` | Paid ad scripts (Meta, Google, referral) |
| `CHECKLIST.md` | Quick-start actions for this week |

## Ground Rules
- If you have a better idea, open an Issue — don't edit files directly yet
- Every change should have a one-line comment explaining why
- We're targeting **online customers** — not just local tradespeople
