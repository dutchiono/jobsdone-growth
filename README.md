## Pricing Strategy

### Current Pricing
$9/month — underpriced and signals low value before anyone reads the features.

### Why We Need to Raise Prices

The market rate for just social media management is $50—$2,500/month.
We do more: website + Google Business + 5 social platforms + auto cross-posting.

At $9 we need 1,111 customers to hit $10k MRR.
At $99 we need 101.

Raising prices also filters for customers who take the service seriously.

### Recommended Tiers

| Tier | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Starter** | $49/mo | Website + Google Business + 1 social platform |
| **Pro** | $99/mo | All 5 platforms + cross-posting automation |
| **Done-For-You** | $199/mo | Pro + we write and schedule 3 posts/week |

### Annual Discount
Offer 2 months free on annual (e.g., $990/yr for Pro = saves ~$200).

### Online Customer Adjustment
For customers outside our local area, lean on the $99 Pro tier as the anchor.
Done-For-You at $199 converts well for online customers who don't want to touch anything.

### Open Questions (discuss in Issues)
- [ ] Should Starter include the website builder or just social?
- [ ] Is $199 DFY competitive vs. Fiverr/Upwork alternatives?
- [ ] Add a free trial tier (7 days, no credit card)?

## Advertising Channels

### Priority Order for Online Customers

We're shifting focus from local-only to online-first. Here's the recommended channel stack:

#### 1. Cold Email (Start Here — Free, Fast)
- Scrape Google Maps for businesses with no website or dead socials
- Also works for online: search Etsy, Thumbtack, Yelp for businesses missing web presence
- Personalize with their name + what's broken ("Your Yelp page has no photos and your website returns a 404")
- See [Cold Email Template](#cold-email-template) for template

#### 2. Facebook & Reddit Groups (Free, Community-Driven)
- Target: small business owner groups, contractor forums, freelancer communities
- Don't spam. Share a before/after result or offer free setup for one member
- Subreddits: r/smallbusiness, r/Contractor, r/pressurewashing, r/lawncare

#### 3. X / Twitter (Brand + Investor Audience)
- Tweet proof-of-work: "We just automated 5 platforms for a landscaper in Phoenix. $99/mo."
- See [Tweet Calendar](#tweet-calendar) for the full tweet bank

#### 4. Meta Ads (Paid — Start Small)
- $10/day, 1 ad set, 1 creative
- Audience: business owners 30–55, US, interests in home services / contracting
- See [Paid Ad Scripts](#paid-ad-scripts) for copy

#### 5. Google Local Services Ads
- Highest intent — people searching "website for my business" or "social media help"
- More expensive but buyer intent is real
- Set up after cold email is proven

#### 6. Referral Program
- Give existing customers 1 month free for each referral who signs up
- Word of mouth from tradespeople is strong (tight-knit communities)

### What NOT to Do Yet
- Don't run ads before email is tested
- Don't pay for influencer posts before organic is working
- Don't build a TikTok presence until bandwidth allows

## Cold Email Template

### When to Use
- Businesses found on Google Maps, Yelp, Thumbtack, or Etsy with no website or dead socials
- Works for online outreach too — just adjust the local reference

### Template

**Subject:** Quick question about [Business Name]'s online presence

---

Hi [First Name],

I was searching for [service they offer] in [city] and came across your listing.

Your work looks solid — but your [website is down / Instagram hasn't posted in 8 months / Google listing has no photos], and I think that's costing you jobs.

I run jobsdone.team. We set up and automate your website, Google Business profile, and social media — fully done for you, starting at $49/month.

No contracts. No tech headaches. We handle the posting.

Want me to show you a quick mock-up of what your online presence could look like? Takes 10 minutes.

— [Your Name]

---

### Sending Tips
- Send 20–30 per day max (avoid spam filters)
- Follow up once after 3 days, then move on
- Personalize the bracketed fields — a generic blast won't convert
- Track opens with a tool like Streak or Mailtrack (free tiers exist)

### Online Variant
For prospects found online (not local), swap:
> "I was searching for [service] in [city]"

With:
> "I came across your [Etsy shop / Thumbtack profile / Yelp page] while looking for [service] providers"

---
