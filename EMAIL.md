# Cold Email Template

## When to Use
- Businesses found on Google Maps, Yelp, Thumbtack, or Etsy with no website or dead socials
- Works for online outreach too — just adjust the local reference

## Template

**Subject:** Quick question about [Business Name]'s online presence

---

Hi [First Name],

I was searching for [service they offer] in [city] and came across your listing.

Your work looks solid — but your [website is down / Instagram hasn't posted in 8 months / Google listing has no photos], and I think that's costing you jobs.

I run jobsdone.team. We set up and automate your website, Google Business profile, and social media — fully done for you, starting at $49/month.

No contracts. No tech headaches. We handle the posting.

Want me to show you a quick mock-up of what your online presence could look like? Takes 10 minutes.

— [Your Name]

## Sending Tips
- Send 20–30 per day max (avoid spam filters)
- Follow up once after 3 days, then move on
- Personalize the bracketed fields — a generic blast won't convert
- Track opens with a tool like Streak or Mailtrack (free tiers exist)

## Online Variant
For prospects found online (not local), swap:
> "I was searching for [service] in [city]"

With:
> "I came across your [Etsy shop / Thumbtack profile / Yelp page] while looking for [service] providers"
