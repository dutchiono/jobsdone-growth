# jobsdone.team — 30-Day Content Calendar & Media Schedule

> One file. Everything your team needs to execute a full month of marketing across X (Twitter), Meta (Facebook/Instagram), and email. Coworker handles the website — this is everything else.

---

## How To Use This
- **X/Twitter**: Post exactly as written or adjust tone. Hashtags included.
- **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)**: Copy adapts for both. Instagram = drop the link, add to bio. Facebook = post with link.
- **Email**: Send to your cold list. Personalize the [NAME] and [BUSINESS] fields.
- **Website**: Separate — your coworker owns that lane.
- Aim to post X daily, Meta 3–4x/week, Email 1x/week.

## WEEK 1 — Awareness & Problem Framing

### Day 1 — X/Twitter
> Most local businesses lose customers every week because their Google listing is outdated and their Facebook page hasn't been touched in 2 years.
> 
> That's not a hustle problem. That's a "no one has time for this" problem.
> 
> We fixed it. → jobsdone.team

### Day 1 — Meta (Facebook/Instagram)
> **Is your business invisible online?**
> 
> Most tradies and local business owners are great at the job — but keeping Google, Facebook, Instagram, and your website updated? That's a full-time role nobody hired for.
> 
> Jobs Done handles all of it automatically. One setup, five platforms, done.
> 
> 👉 jobsdone.team — link in bio

### Day 2 — X/Twitter
> Your competitor just showed up #1 on Google.
> 
> They're not better than you. They just have an updated profile, recent reviews, and a website that loads in 2 seconds.
> 
> jobsdone.team fixes all three. Automatically.

### Day 3 — X/Twitter
> We built Jobs Done for the plumber who's booked 6 weeks out but has zero online presence.
> 
> For the cleaner who does great work but can't be found on Google.
> 
> For anyone who's good at the job and tired of the internet part.
> 
> jobsdone.team

### Day 3 — Meta
> **You're great at your job. The internet part shouldn't slow you down.**
> 
> Jobs Done automatically keeps your website, Google Business, Facebook, Instagram, and more updated — so customers can find you, trust you, and book you.

### Day 5 — X/Twitter
> The average small business owner spends 6+ hours a week on social media and online listings.

> 
> jobsdone.team

### Day 5 — Email (Cold Outreach — Week 1)
> **Subject: Quick question about [BUSINESS NAME]**
>
> Hey [NAME],
>
> Found you on Google while looking for [SERVICE] in [CITY]. You do great work — I could tell from the reviews.
>
> One thing I noticed: your [website / Facebook / Google listing] hasn't been updated recently. For a lot of businesses like yours, that's costing bookings — people search, can't find clear info, and move on.
>
> We built Jobs Done specifically for this. It automatically keeps your website, Google Business, Facebook, and Instagram current — without you touching any of it.
>
> Would it be worth a quick look? jobsdone.team
